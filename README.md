# 📄 GitHub Resume Builder

A simple and beginner-friendly tool that automatically generates a professional resume by extracting project data from a user's GitHub account.

---

## 📌 Project Description

**GitHub Resume Builder** is designed to help developers — especially beginners — showcase their work without writing resumes manually. This tool fetches your GitHub repositories and analyzes details like:

- Repository names
- Descriptions
- Programming languages used
- GitHub links
- Commit history (optional)

It then organizes this information into a clean, modern resume that can be exported as an HTML page (and later as a PDF).

This project is great for learning:
- How to interact with public APIs (like GitHub's)
- How to build a frontend and backend web app
- How to extract and display useful data from a profile
- Resume formatting and export tools
